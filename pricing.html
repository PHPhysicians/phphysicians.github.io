									<h3>Join Our Community</h3>
									<p>I struggled with my own transition and my career path years ago. I had no idea where to turn or what to do and I made a few bad decisions along my path to total non-clinical transition and my “dream job”. I used to feel desperation, anger and fear as I faced every day. Now I look forward to my work and life every day! It still blows my mind when I stop to think about where I was then and where I am now. Because of my struggle, I started helping other physicians in their own transitions or diversification of their career. I’ve been doing this for over ten years now and have had the privilege of helping hundreds of doctors all over the country.</p>
									<p>Most of us in this community felt the same way. Being part of this nonclinical community is simple – there is no travel involved and there is support and communication with us. I serve as a physician mentor and we work together as physician colleagues, as do many of the other physicians you will read about, watch or hear from.</p>
									<p>This community is unique because it’s not a “cookie cutter” approach to career transition or strategy. Every doctor is different and is coming from a different place. Some are 1-2 years out of residency and others have been in private practice for 10 years or more before finding this community. It’s been our experience that 80-90% of the time, physicians who works with this community will have clear focus and career direction within 6-8 months. Most doctors have been struggling with this on their own for years, if not decades.</p>
									<p>We help you identify where it is you want to be, but more importantly, we guide you through the practicalities of how to get there. We can help you find ways to revitalize your current career in medicine or diversify yourself with non-clinical options or a completely non-clinical career.</p>
